# Assignments Repository

This repository contains code and solutions based on a collection of programming assignments. These assignments are intended to build foundational skills in C programming, data structures, memory management, and algorithmic thinking.

##  Structure

Each assignment is organized in its own folder and includes:

- Source code files (`.c`, `.h`)
- A `Makefile` for building and running programs
- Sample inputs/outputs or test cases (when applicable)

##  Topics Covered

- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
- Pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Linked lists (singly, doubly)
- Stacks and queues
- Trees (e.g., binary search trees)
- Recursion and iterative algorithms

##  Getting Started

To build and run a program:
```bash
make
make run
